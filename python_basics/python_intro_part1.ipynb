    "Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is used for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* web development (server-side)\n",
    "* software development\n",
    "* mathematics\n",
    "* system scripting\n",

    "### **What can Python do?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* can be used on a server to create web applications\n",
    "* can be used alongside software to create workflows\n",
    "* can connect to database systems\n",
    "* can read and modify files\n",
    "* can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics\n",
    "* can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc)\n",
    "* has a simple syntax similar to the English language\n",
    "* has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages\n",
    "* runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written (quick prototyping)\n",
    "* can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way"
