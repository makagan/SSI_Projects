What happens if you swap out all `GCNConv` instances with [`GATConv`](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/nn.html#torch_geometric.nn.conv.GATConv) layers that make use of attention? Try to write a 2-layer `GAT` model that makes use of 8 attention heads in the first layer and 1 attention head in the second layer, uses a `dropout` ratio of `0.6` inside and outside each `GATConv` call, and uses a `hidden_channels` dimensions of `8` per head."
